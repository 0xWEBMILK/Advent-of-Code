## Description

This repository contains my solutions to problems from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) â€” an annual programming competition held in December. Every day a new challenge is released, featuring unique puzzles that require logical and algorithmic thinking.

Solutions are provided in Python, focusing on readability, efficiency, and modern approaches.

- **`solution.py`** â€” the main solution for the challenge.
- **`input.txt`** â€” sample input data.
- **`README.md`** (optional) â€” description of the problem.
